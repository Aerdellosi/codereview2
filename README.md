# *The Suggested Programming Language Standardized Battery Evaluation* (TSPLSBE)  

This program will use quantessimalistic algorithm spiralling and a series of fill-in-the-dot questions to determine which programming language is best suited for the user. Upon completion of the program, the chosen language will be suggested to the user at the bottom of the page.

The program's criteria are as follows: 
  * Those who are low in neuroticism and adventurousness, and who most agree with the statement 

> All innovation is beautiful

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; will be suggested Python.
  * Those who are high in empathy, moderate in neuroticism, and who most agree with the statement
  
>Although the value of art lies in the eye of the beholder, it is an ethical imperative that humans continue to value human art above all others, because to devalue humanity at our most human is to begin the descent into devaluing humanity at all strata of life
  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; will be suggested Javascript.
 * Those who are high in energy and psychopathy will be assigned **GO**.
